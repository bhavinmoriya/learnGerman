The word "**erhalten**" in German has a couple of different core meanings, but in simple terms, it mostly means either **to get/receive** or **to keep/maintain**.

Here are the key concepts and examples for each:

---

## 1. To Get or Receive

This is the most common meaning. It's a slightly more formal way of saying "to get" or "to receive" something.

**Concept:** Something is given to you, sent to you, or you obtain it.

**Simple Example:**
* You **receive** a letter.
    * *Ich habe einen **Brief erhalten**.* (I have **received** a letter.)

**Other Examples:**
* **To get a prize:** *Er hat einen Preis **erhalten**.* (He **received** a prize.)
* **To obtain a result:** *Wir haben ein gutes Ergebnis **erhalten**.* (We **obtained** a good result.)

## 2. To Keep or Maintain (To Preserve)

This meaning is about making sure something stays in good condition or continues to exist.

**Concept:** You actively work to keep something safe, protected, or in its current state.

**Simple Example:**
* You **keep** an old building from falling apart.
    * *Das alte Haus muss **erhalten** werden.* (The old house must be **preserved** / **maintained**.)

**Other Examples:**

Since you're looking at a page titled "Le Chat" (which means "The Cat" in French), if you were reading a story or article, the context would tell you which meaning is being used.

* If it's about a character getting a cat, it means **to receive**.
* If it's about someone trying to keep a cat healthy or an old home safe, it means **to maintain/preserve**.
